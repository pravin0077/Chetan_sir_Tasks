------------------------To install Node Exporter, follow these steps. Repeat these instructions for every client.---------------------

wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.5.0/node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------
Extract the application

tar xvfz node_exporter-*.tar.gz
----------------------------------------
Move the executable to usr/local/bin so it is accessible throughout the system.

sudo mv node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64/node_exporter /usr/local/bin

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional) Remove any remaining files.

rm -r node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64*

--------------------------------------------------------

There are two ways of running Node Exporter.
It can be launched from the terminal using the command node_exporter. Or, it can be activated as a system service.
Running it from the terminal is less convenient. But this might not be a problem if the tool is only intended for occasional use.
To run Node Exporter manually, use the following command. The terminal outputs details regarding the statistics collection process.

node_exporter

-------------------------------------
It is more convenient to run Node Exporter as a service. To run Node Exporter this way, first, create a node_exporter user.

sudo useradd -rs /bin/false node_exporter

Create a service file for systemctl to use. The file must be named node_exporter.service and should have the following format. Most of the fields are similar to those found in prometheus.service, as described in the previous section.

sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service

---- File: /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
[Unit]
Description=Node Exporter
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=node_exporter
Group=node_exporter
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

----------------------------------------------------------
(Optional) If you intend to monitor the client on an ongoing basis, use the systemctl enable command to automatically launch Node Exporter at boot time
 This continually exposes the system metrics on port 9100. If Node Exporter is only intended for occasional use, do not use the command below.

sudo systemctl enable node_exporter

----------------------------------------------------------------
Reload the systemctl daemon, start Node Exporter, and verify its status. The service should be active.

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start node_exporter
sudo systemctl status node_exporter
-----------------------------------------------

Use a web browser to visit port 9100 on the client node, for example, http://local_ip_addr:9100.
A page entitled Node Exporter is displayed along with a link reading Metrics. Click the Metrics link and
confirm the statistics are being collected. For a detailed explanation of the various statistics, see the Node Exporter Documentation.

-----------------------------------------How to Configure Prometheus to Monitor Client Nodes--------------------------------------

On the monitoring server running Prometheus, open prometheus.yml for editing.

sudo vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

----------------------------
Locate the section entitled scrape_configs, which contains a list of jobs. It currently lists a single job named prometheus. This job monitors the local Prometheus task on port 9090. Beneath the prometheus job, add a second job having the job_name of remote_collector. Include the following information.

A scrape_interval of 10s.
Inside static_configs in the targets attribute, add a bracketed list of the IP addresses to monitor. Separate each entry using a comma.
Append the port number :9100 to each IP address.
To enable monitoring of the local server, add an entry for localhost:9100 to the list.
The entry should resemble the following example. Replace remote_addr with the actual IP address of the client.

File: /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
...
- job_name: "remote_collector"
  scrape_interval: 10s
  static_configs:
    - targets: ["remote_addr:9100"]
	
----------------------------------------------
To immediately refresh Prometheus, restart the prometheus service.

sudo systemctl restart prometheus
